        Generate forecasts for time series data using an sktime model.

        This method produces point forecasts and, optionally, prediction
        intervals or quantile forecasts. The input DataFrame can contain one
        or multiple time series in stacked (long) format.

        Prediction intervals and quantile forecasts are not currently supported
        with sktime based models

        Args:
            df (pd.DataFrame):
                DataFrame containing the time series to forecast. It must
                include as columns:

                    - "unique_id": an ID column to distinguish multiple series.
                    - "ds": a time column indicating timestamps or periods.
                    - "y": a target column with the observed values.

            h (int):
                Forecast horizon specifying how many future steps to predict.
            freq (str, optional):
                Frequency of the time series (e.g. "D" for daily, "M" for
                monthly). See [Pandas frequency aliases](https://pandas.pydata.org/
                pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#offset-aliases) for
                valid values. If not provided, the frequency will be inferred
                from the data.
            level (list[int | float], optional):
                Confidence levels for prediction intervals, expressed as
                percentages (e.g. [80, 95]). If provided, the returned
                DataFrame will include lower and upper interval columns for
                each specified level.
            quantiles (list[float], optional):
                List of quantiles to forecast, expressed as floats between 0
                and 1. Should not be used simultaneously with `level`. When
                provided, the output DataFrame will contain additional columns
                named in the format "model-q-{percentile}", where {percentile}
                = 100 × quantile value.

        Returns:
            pd.DataFrame:
                DataFrame containing forecast results. Includes:

                    - point forecasts for each timestamp and series.
                    - prediction intervals if `level` is specified.
                    - quantile forecasts if `quantiles` is specified.

                For multi-series data, the output retains the same unique
                identifiers as the input DataFrame.

        Example:
            ```python
            import pandas as pd
